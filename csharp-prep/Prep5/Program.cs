 * 
 * Assignment
 *      Ask the user for a series of numbers, and append each one to a list. Stop when they enter 0.
 *      Once you have a list, have your program do the following:
 *   
 * Core Requirements
 *      Work through these core requirements step-by-step to complete the program. Please don't skip
 *   ahead and do the whole thing at once, because others on your team may benefit from building the
 *   program up slowly.
 *      1) Compute the sum, or total, of the numbers in the list.
 *      2) Compute the average of the numbers in the list.
 *      3) Find the maximum, or largest, number in the list.
 * 
 * Stretch Challenge
 *      1) Have the user enter both positive and negative numbers, then find the smallest positive
 *   number (the positive number that is closest to zero).
 *      2) Sort the numbers in the list and display the new, sorted list. Hint: There are C# libraries
 *   that can help you here, try searching the internet for them.
